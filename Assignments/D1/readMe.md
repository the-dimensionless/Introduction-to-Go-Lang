* Difference between compiled v/s interpreted languages: 
    Compiled languages are converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute. As a result, they tend to be faster and more efficient to execute than interpreted languages. They also give the developer more control over hardware aspects, like memory management and CPU usage.
    Disadvantage:
    1. Additional time needed to complete the entire compilation step before testing
    2. Platform dependence of the generated binary code

    Interpreters run through a program line by line and execute each command. Here, if the author decides he wants to use a different kind of olive oil, he could scratch the old one out and add the new one.
    Interpreted languages were once significantly slower than compiled languages. But, with the development of just-in-time compilation, that gap is shrinking.

    Disadvantage:
    1. The most notable disadvantage is typical execution speed compared to compiled languages.

    Examples of common interpreted languages are PHP, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript.

* Difference between statically typed and dynamically typed languages: 

    Statically typed programming languages do type checking (i.e. the process of verifying and enforcing the constraints of types) at compile-time as opposed to run-time.
    Dynamically typed programming languages do type checking at run-time as opposed to compile-time.
    Examples of statically typed languages are: Java, C, C++
    Examples of dynamically typed languages are: Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, JavaScript
